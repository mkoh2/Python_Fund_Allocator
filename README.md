# Python_Fund_Allocator

I used Python to create a simple fund allocator to emulate a "Lazy Portfolio."

You have the option of investing using Schwab (for investors with principal greater than or equal to 
$1000 and less than $3000) and Vanguard (for investors with principal greater than or equal to $3000).

I'm trying to figure out how to automatically pull the index fund daily quotes from Google Finance.
